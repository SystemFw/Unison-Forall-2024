## Description

In this talk we’ll look at the implementation of KLogs, a distributed
streaming library built entirely on [Unison Cloud](https://www.unison.cloud/).

We’ll start our journey in the beautiful landscape of functional
programming APIs, and then take an ability handler to the perilous
world of distributed systems, a world where we need fences, leases,
shards and view changes to make our system scalable and resilient. We
will learn how to implement those standard techniques on Unison Cloud,
and then discuss the unique optimisations enabled by its innovative
combination of features.
